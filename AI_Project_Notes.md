# AI Project Notes (Updated March 2, 2025)

## 1. Understanding GitHub & Open-Source Libraries

### GitHub Overview
GitHub is a cloud-based platform for **version control and collaboration**. It allows you to store, track, and manage code while working on projects individually or with a team. It is built on **Git**, a version control system that helps track changes.

### Key GitHub Concepts
- **Repository (Repo)** – A storage space for your project (code, files, documentation, etc.).
- **Commit** – A snapshot of changes made to the files.
- **Branch** – A separate version of the project where you can work on new features without affecting the main project.
- **Pull Request (PR)** – A request to merge changes from one branch into another.
- **Forking** – Copying someone else's repository to modify it independently.
- **Issues** – Used for tracking bugs, feature requests, and discussions.
- **README.md** – A documentation file describing the project.

### GitHub Workflow Overview
1. **Create a Repository** – Store and organize your project files.
2. **Clone the Repository** – Work on the project locally.
3. **Make Changes & Commit** – Save progress with snapshots.
4. **Push to GitHub** – Upload updates to the cloud.
5. **Create Branches & Merge** – Work on new features safely.
6. **Collaborate with Others** – Fork projects, create issues, and submit pull requests.

## 2. Finding & Using Open-Source Libraries

### What are Open-Source Libraries?
Open-source libraries are publicly available codebases that anyone can use, modify, and contribute to. Instead of reinventing the wheel, you can integrate these libraries into your project.

### Where to Find Open-Source Libraries?
- **GitHub Trending**: [https://github.com/trending](https://github.com/trending)
- **Hugging Face (AI models)**: [https://huggingface.co/models](https://huggingface.co/models)
- **Awesome Lists (curated open-source projects)**: [https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
- **NPM (JavaScript packages)**: [https://www.npmjs.com/](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- **PyPI (Python packages)**: [https://pypi.org/](https://pypi.org/)

### How to Use a Library from GitHub?
1. Find a library that fits your needs.
2. Read the **README.md** for installation instructions.
3. Clone or download the repository.
4. Install dependencies (`npm install` for Node.js, `pip install` for Python).
5. Integrate it into your project.
